# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Gatsby Application that calculates a Recommended Tip from a Number. A website like this has a lot of use cases, such as easily calculating a tip for a waiter at a restaurant.

# Builds

The source code contained in this repository is a development build of the application and therefore may be unstable from time to time. If you would like to use this website or test it out, I recommend grabbing a Production Build from the <a href="https://github.com/105hua/Tip-Calculator/releases">Releases</a> section.
